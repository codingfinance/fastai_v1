up ; appearing as both a xxmaj daily and on xxmaj sunday 's xxmaj color xxmaj comics xxmaj supplement , xxup puck , xxup the xxup comics xxup weekly . xxmaj you know , \" xxmaj what xxmaj fools xxmaj these xxmaj mortals xxmaj be ! \" xxmaj remember that one , xxmaj schultz ? xxup in viewing the chubby , little , bald boy xxmaj comic xxmaj strip ' xxmaj hero ' and his on screen antics , both solo and in tandem with xxmaj miss xxmaj betty ; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled . xxmaj the story and xxmaj director xxmaj dave xxmaj fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip - like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little xxmaj henry . xxmaj these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page ; as the xxup henry xxmaj feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color ' mime ' . \n"," \n","  xxup in the cartoon , titled xxup betty xxup boop xxup with xxup henry : xxup the xxup funniest xxup living xxmaj american ( xxmaj fleischer xxmaj studios / xxmaj paramount xxmaj pictures xxmaj corporation , 1935 ) , we see what is ; basically being a one situational exercise ; being punctuated with the usual array of xxmaj dave xxmaj fleischer 's rapid fire , machine gun - like gags . xxmaj in short , xxmaj henry spots a puppy in the window of xxmaj betty xxmaj boop 's xxmaj pet xxmaj shop . xxmaj it is a sort of love at first sight as xxmaj henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had , to coins in his pocket . xxmaj he is in formed by xxmaj miss xxmaj boop that it would be $ 2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase . xxmaj tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly . \n"," \n","  xxup but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as xxmaj betty asks the boy to mind the store , while she leaves on urgent business . xxmaj in return for his services , xxmaj miss xxmaj betty promises him the little dog in return . xxmaj of course , they have a deal and xxmaj betty leaves . \n"," \n","  xxup getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the xxmaj fleischer xxmaj crew to fire up a whole new string of gags ; this time featuring bird seed , xxmaj henry 's bald pate and push brooms . ( xxmaj but not all at once of course , xxmaj schultz ! ) xxmaj henry 's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store 's avian population by first literally xxunk his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds ; out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break . \n"," \n","  xxup betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with xxmaj henry 's temporary xxunk care . xxmaj all bets were off , no doggie for xxmaj henry . xxmaj he begins to leave ; dejectedly ; but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up . xxmaj his head covered with bird seed , he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures ; returning them to their pet store coop . xxmaj happily , the little fella leaves ; but this time he has his own affectionate , little , face licking puppy . \n"," \n","  xxup xxunk this was a winning combination . xxmaj we have the carefree , energy filled , free wheeling of the boy , the kindness of xxmaj betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the ' boy and his dog ' situation . xxmaj max and xxmaj dave xxmaj fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini - masterpiece of a surreal comedy short . \n"," \n","  xxup we were quite surprised that no xxup henry xxmaj series followed . xxmaj judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character , it certainly could have been sustained for some time . xxmaj at any rate , this teaming was in many ways the best of the xxmaj betty xxmaj boop try out pictures . xxmaj although the first , xxup popeye xxup the xxup sailor ( xxmaj fleischer / xxmaj paramount , 1933 ) , was the most successful ( and barely had any xxmaj betty xxmaj boop in it , save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer ) ; the xxup henry xxmaj short was much better than the two following xxmaj king xxmaj features \" tryouts \" , xxup betty xxup boop xxup and xxup the xxup little xxup king and xxup betty xxup boop xxup and xxup little xxup jimmy , both 1936 . \n"," \n","  xxup poodle xxup schnitz ! !,xxbos xxmaj we fans of xxmaj ed xxmaj wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place , but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan - dom that i have never before approached ! xxmaj one of the most intense thrills of non - mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as i am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure . i remember how , as a teenager , i longed to see xxmaj eddie 's \" xxmaj revenge of the xxmaj dead \" ( a.k.a . \" xxmaj night of the xxmaj ghouls \" ) , which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades . xxmaj likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as xxmaj doris xxmaj wishman 's \" a xxmaj night to xxmaj dismember \" or half the works of xxmaj jesus xxmaj franco ! xxmaj however , recent years have seen video and xxup dvd rendering these once xxunk treasures almost xxup too accessible - even for those of us on the ' wrong ' ( ! ) side of the xxmaj atlantic xxrep 4 . \n"," \n","  xxmaj and then , behold , there was \" i xxmaj woke xxmaj up xxmaj early the xxmaj day i xxmaj died \" - a movie that xxup should have been so ' big ' , yet which disappeared into the ether even before xxmaj fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite . xxmaj the 1990s xxup needed a hard - to - find movie though which would xxup really be worth hunting out : and this , to be sure is it xxrep 4 . i do n't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy - yet - kitsch cast , its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals , its wondrous moments of \" pure cinema \" ( in the sense of the 1920s xxmaj french cineastes ) and surrealism , or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here . \n"," \n","  xxmaj what i xxup do wish to mention , briefly , is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost - lost - to - us - but - thankfully - not - quite movie ! i think the xxmaj german video , which i picked up while in xxmaj cologne on a cold crisp winter 's day , is fairly well - known to xxmaj ed xxmaj wood 's followers now . xxmaj it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released . xxmaj however , there is thankfully more to be found ! ! ! xxmaj firstly , there are a number of reviews available from the film 's xxmaj german xxup theatrical release - i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to \" xxmaj xxunk \" my students xxrep 5 . some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film 's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the xxmaj american trash xxup and xxmaj european arthouse traditions . xxmaj secondly , there is the score by xxmaj larry xxmaj xxunk ' , which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener , particularly if you are contemplating the film 's currently \" vaulted \" status and growing a little melancholy at the same time . xxmaj finally - for now - i wish to mention the promo xxup soundtrack that xxmaj xxunk put out in extremely limited numbers . xxup beg , xxup borrow , xxup steal , xxup kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these xxrep 6 !

\" xxmaj remember that one , xxmaj schultz ? xxup in viewing the chubby , little , bald boy xxmaj comic xxmaj strip ' xxmaj hero ' and his on screen antics , both solo and in tandem with xxmaj miss xxmaj betty ; we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled . xxmaj the story and xxmaj director xxmaj dave xxmaj fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip - like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little xxmaj henry . xxmaj these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page ; as the xxup henry xxmaj feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color ' mime ' . \n"," \n","  xxup in the cartoon , titled xxup betty xxup boop xxup with xxup henry : xxup the xxup funniest xxup living xxmaj american ( xxmaj fleischer xxmaj studios / xxmaj paramount xxmaj pictures xxmaj corporation , 1935 ) , we see what is ; basically being a one situational exercise ; being punctuated with the usual array of xxmaj dave xxmaj fleischer 's rapid fire , machine gun - like gags . xxmaj in short , xxmaj henry spots a puppy in the window of xxmaj betty xxmaj boop 's xxmaj pet xxmaj shop . xxmaj it is a sort of love at first sight as xxmaj henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had , to coins in his pocket . xxmaj he is in formed by xxmaj miss xxmaj boop that it would be $ 2.00 in depression era money to make the purchase . xxmaj tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly . \n"," \n","  xxup but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as xxmaj betty asks the boy to mind the store , while she leaves on urgent business . xxmaj in return for his services , xxmaj miss xxmaj betty promises him the little dog in return . xxmaj of course , they have a deal and xxmaj betty leaves . \n"," \n","  xxup getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the xxmaj fleischer xxmaj crew to fire up a whole new string of gags ; this time featuring bird seed , xxmaj henry 's bald pate and push brooms .
